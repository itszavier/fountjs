FADE IN:

hello world

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

A dimly lit room. A laptop hums on a messy bed.

IMANI
I have nothing.

He stares at the screen. Lines of code scroll past.

IMANI
But I can still build.

The cursor blinks.

EXT. STREET - MORNING

Cars rush by. Life moves fast.

IMANI
(quietly)
I just need one thing to work.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

The screen lights up.

IMANI
Let’s go.
